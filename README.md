HPGe-NaI
========

Kaitlin Howell's summer REU project

This is a small, fast simulation of a gamma-ray scale photon
propagating through solid materials.  The goal is to be able to deal
with photons in the 10's of keV to few MeV range, and to simulate a
cylindrical HPGe detector and a surrounding cylindrical shell of
NaI/BGO as a Compton reject/supression system.
